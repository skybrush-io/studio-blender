Once you are finished with your drone show, use the Export panel to export it from Blender to different formats for further processing or direct upload to the drones.

The available output formats depend on whether you selected the "Indoor" or "Outdoor" setting in the xref:panels/formations/swarm.adoc[Swarm panel]'s btn:[Show type] dropdown, and also on your specific license purchased.

The following options are available in general...

== Export to .skyc

The Skybrush compiled show format is a single-file descriptor of your complete drone show. It is used as the primary drone show format throughout the entire *Skybrush* suite:

* If you wish to visualize or verify your show or you simply want to send a link with an interactive 3D visualization of the show to your clients, use *Skybrush Viewer*.

* If you want to execute your drone show on your real drones, use *Skybrush Live*.

If you press the btn:[Export Skybrush SKYC] button, you have to choose the path and filename of your output file. There are also some parameters you can setup conveniently:

Export selected drones only:: Export all or only selected drones

Frame range:: Define the frame range of the output (Storyboard / Render / Preview / Current formation or transition)

Trajectory FPS:: Set output frame rate for drone trajectories (make sure it is a submultiple of your render FPS)

Light FPS:: Set the output frame rate for light programs (make sure it is a submultiple of your render FPS)

Export yaw:: Enable this checkbox to output rotations around the yaw (vertical) axis of your drone objects into the .skyc file

Export cameras:: Enable this checkbox to export Blender cameras into the .skyc file (to be used by Skybrush Viewer).

== Export to CSV

The trajectories and LED light colors of the drones can also be sampled at regular intervals and exported to CSV files for further post-processing in external tools. This option appears only if you have installed and enabled the CSV export addon that is distributed separately. The CSV export will produce a single ZIP file that contains multiple CSV files, one for each drone, with the following columns: time (milliseconds), X, Y and Z coordinates (meters) and the red, green and blue components of the color of the LED light, in the usual 0-255 range.

TIP: We recommend using Skybrush Live for drone show control, together with the official Skybrush Compiled Format (.skyc), as it contains a lot more information about your show in a more optimized way than this simple CSV representation.

If you press the btn:[Export Skybrush CSV] button, you have to choose the path and filename of your output file. There are also some parameters you can setup conveniently:

Export selected drones only:: Export all or only selected drones

Frame range:: Define the frame range of the output (Storyboard / Render / Preview / Current formation or transition)

Frame rate:: Set output frame rate of drone trajectories and light programs (make sure it is a submultiple of your render FPS)

NOTE: Special characters in drone names are converted to standard characters in the exported filenames.


== Export validation report

The btn:[Export validation report] button creates a unique safety report of your show in .pdf format for standalone self-checking, validated reporting or as a supplement for flight permissions or other administration purposes.

The validation report starts with a summary of flight statistics and safety test results, and continues with detailed plots on all aspects of the implemented safety checks.

.IMPORTANT
****
The validation .pdf is created by a local or remote instance of *Skybrush Studio Server* running in the background. As creating the validation report is resource intensive, access to this feature might be disabled on our public server and might be only available through a paid license option. If you need but do not have access, visit https://shop.skybrush.io[Skybrush Store] for obtaining the proper *Skybrush Studio Server* license.

Frame range:: Define the frame range of the output (Storyboard / Render / Preview / Current formation or transition)

Trajectory FPS:: Set output sampling frame rate for drone trajectories (make sure it is a submultiple of your render FPS)

Light FPS:: Set the output sample frame rate for light programs (make sure it is a submultiple of your render FPS)

Plot positions:: Include position-related plots in the safety report

Plot velocities:: Include velocity-related plots in the safety report

Plot projected drift:: Include projected drift plots in the safety report

Plot nearest neighbor:: Include a unified nearest neighbor plot in the safety report

Plot all nearest neighbors:: Include nearest neighbor curves on a per-drone basis on a separate page of the safety report.
+
WARNING: Creating this plot might take a longer time, depending on the number of drones, frames and output frame rate.

Create individual drone plots:: Include validation plots for each drone individually on separate pages in the final output.

WARNING: Creating these plots might take a long time, depending on the number of drones, frames and output frame rate.

== Export to third-party show formats

Upon purchasing a professional license, we provide additional exporters to various external drone show formats. mailto:support@collmot.com[Contact us] for details.
